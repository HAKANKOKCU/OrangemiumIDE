# Get Started
First you have to compile the IDE, then you should download "/IconTheme" folder then go to "File > Settings > Themes > Icon Pack" then put the folder's path into the textbox, then restart the IDE
## Compiling
To compile the IDE (which is located at "/OrangemiumIDE" at this repo), download "/OrangemiumIDE", then go to "./OrangemiumIDE.Desktop", then you can use dotnet to build the project: `dotnet build ./OrangemiumIDE.Desktop.csproj` 
# Extensions
This does support extensions, but I didn't write documentation about it yet.
